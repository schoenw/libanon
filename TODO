Make the anon pcap command do something more sensible.

The anon int64 and anon uint64 go into a loop if the number range is
too small. Perhaps the bounds should be optional in the first place?

The manual page needs completion.

We might want to introduce global options to reduce the duplicated
code.  For example, the "-p passphrase" could be a global option and
we could pass down a suitable key to the cmd functions.

Make sure we refer to the LGPL everywhere.
